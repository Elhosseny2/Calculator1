# Calculator1
This is a revamped version of my previous project https://github.com/Elhosseny2/Calculator. 
In this iteration, I focused on enhancing the JavaScript logic while retaining -quit- the same CSS layout.

**whereâ€™s the fun in solutions that do all the work for you?**

So i improved and structured JavaScript logic for better functionality and maintainability (no more eval()).

And now Code refactored for cleaner and more modular JavaScript.

This project builds upon my earlier learned lessons and reflects my growth Web development.

Along journey during Foundation course through https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations i'v learned a lot and really gained a punch of good knowledge and i consider it a significant milestone in my learning journey.

i'm learning = i'm alive
